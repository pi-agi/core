# Welcome to @pi-agi/core Library

Welcome to the next step in the evolution of the PI AGI project. As we continue to transform the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we are proud to introduce our latest innovation: the @pi-agi/core library.

This library is a comprehensive toolkit that empowers you to create and customize your own AGI. Built upon the foundation of the PI AGI project, this library puts the power of personalization at your fingertips, allowing you to define AGI actions and behaviors that are perfectly tailored to your unique needs and aspirations.

We've taken the robust and versatile AGI framework from the original PI AGI project and packaged it as an easy-to-use library. Now, you can focus on what truly matters: crafting an AGI that aligns with your vision, without getting bogged down in the complexities of the underlying system.

## @pi-agi/core: Powering Personalized Artificial General Intelligence

The @pi-agi/core library brings forth a new era of AI development. By providing a base for role-based AGIs that can be personalized and optimized for specific tasks, we've unlocked the true potential of AGI.

This library provides core functionalities for PI AGI applications. Users can effortlessly implement AGI, set main and next prompts, and define actions that implement the `Actionable` interface. With @pi-agi/core, creating your own AGI is as easy as defining what you want it to do.

## The Ultimate Vision

Our vision remains unchanged: to create a future where personalized AGIs become an integral part of our daily lives. With the @pi-agi/core library, we are one step closer to realizing this vision. We believe that by giving users the tools to create their own AGIs, we can drive innovation in various domains and truly revolutionize the way we work and live.

## Getting Started

To get started with the @pi-agi/core library, you will first need to install it as a dependency in your project. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @pi-agi/core
# or
yarn add @pi-agi/core
```

Once the library is installed, you can start defining your AGI's actions and behaviors. For more information on how to do this, please refer to our [documentation](./docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
