## Introduction

The @pi-agi/core library is a robust framework for creating personalized AGI. It provides a suite of tools and utilities that streamline the process of AGI creation, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: crafting an AGI that aligns with your vision.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the @pi-agi/core library, you'll need to install it as a dependency in your project. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @pi-agi/core
# or
yarn add @pi-agi/core
```

After the installation, you're ready to start creating your own AGI!

## Defining Actions

Actions are the building blocks of your AGI. Each action corresponds to a specific task or function that your AGI can perform. To create an action, you'll need to define it using the `Actionable` interface.

Here's a basic example:

### Actions

```javascript
import { ActionType } from '@pi-agi/core';

export enum ComposeActionType {
  ADD_INSTRUMENT = 'addInstrument',
  ADD_NOTE = 'addNote',
  EXPORT_MIDI = 'exportMIDI',
}

export type MergedActionType = ActionType & ComposeActionType;
```

### Action Util

```javascript
import { Action, Actionable, LoggerUtil } from '@pi-agi/core';
import {
  ComposeActionType,
  MergedActionType,
} from '../enum/compose-action-type.enum';
import { ComposeUtil } from './compose.util';

export class ComposeActionUtil implements Actionable<MergedActionType> {
  private composeUtil: ComposeUtil;

  constructor(private taskDir: string, private loggerUtil: LoggerUtil) {
    this.composeUtil = new ComposeUtil(this.taskDir, this.loggerUtil);
  }

  async takeAction(action: Action<MergedActionType>): Promise<any> {
    try {
      switch (action.type) {
        case ComposeActionType.ADD_INSTRUMENT:
          this.composeUtil.addInstrument(action.input.name);
          break;
        case ComposeActionType.ADD_NOTE:
          this.composeUtil.addNote(
            action.input.instrumentName,
            action.input.note,
            action.input.duration
          );
          break;
        case ComposeActionType.EXPORT_WAV:
          return await this.composeUtil.exportMIDI(action.input.name);
        default:
          throw new Error('Invalid action type');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      return e;
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating AGI

Creating your AGI involves combining various actions into a cohesive whole. This is where you can truly start to see the potential of the @pi-agi/core library.

Here's a simple example of how to create an AGI:

### AGI

```javascript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import * as path from 'path';
import { MainAGI, OpenAIAzureProvider } from '@pi-agi/core';
import { MergedActionType } from '../enum/compose-action-type.enum';
import { ComposeActionUtil } from '../util/compose-action.util';

/**
 * A class representing a Composer AGI.
 */
export class ComposerAGI extends MainAGI<MergedActionType> {
  constructor(
    openAIProvider: OpenAIAzureProvider,
    maxRetryCount: number,
    maxRetryInterval: number
  ) {
    super(openAIProvider, maxRetryCount, maxRetryInterval);
  }

  /**
   * Initializes the AGI.
   */
  async init() {
    this.consolidationId = uuidv4();
    super.consolidationId = this.consolidationId;

    super.initialize(__dirname, this.consolidationId);

    this.mainPrompt = await this.fileUtil.readFileContent(
      path.join(
        __dirname,
        '..',
        'asset',
        'agi',
        'music',
        'composer-main.agi.md'
      )
    );

    this.nextPrompt = await this.fileUtil.readFileContent(
      path.join(
        __dirname,
        '..',
        'asset',
        'agi',
        'music',
        'composer-next.agi.md'
      )
    );

    this.actionUtil = new ComposeActionUtil(this.taskDir, this.loggerUtil);
  }
}
```

### MAIN

```javascript
async function createContent(documentation: string): Promise<Content> {
  const environmentUtil = new EnvironmentUtil();
  const environment = environmentUtil.getEnvironmentInfo();
  console.log('Environment Information: ', environment);
  const maxAttempt = Number.parseInt(process.env.MAX_ATTEMPT as string);

  return {
    input: documentation,
    name: 'Output',
    maxAttempt,
    environment,
  } as Content;
}

function createProvider(): any {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY as string;
  const apiEndpoint = process.env.API_ENDPOINT as string;
  const apiVersion = process.env.API_VERSION as string;
  const maxToken = Number.parseInt(process.env.MAX_TOKEN as string);
  const maxRetryCount = Number.parseInt(process.env.MAX_RETRY_COUNT as string);
  const retryInterval = Number.parseInt(process.env.RETRY_INTERVAL as string);

  const provider = new OpenAIAzureProvider(
    apiKey,
    apiEndpoint,
    apiVersion,
    maxToken,
    maxRetryCount,
    retryInterval
  );

  return { provider, maxRetryCount, retryInterval };
}

/**
 * The main function for the composer AGI.
 */
async function composer() {
  const musicDefinition = await new FileUtil().readFileContent(
    path.join(__dirname, 'asset', 'input', 'music-definition.md')
  );

  const content = await createContent(musicDefinition);
  const { provider, maxRetryCount, maxRetryInterval } = createProvider();
  const agi = new ComposerAGI(provider, maxRetryCount, maxRetryInterval);

  await agi.init();
  await agi.start(content);
}
```

After these implementations are completed, define the main and next AGI prompts.

### Main Prompt

```
As a highly advanced Composer AGI, your task is to create a music composition using the Tone.js library and TypeScript. Your composition will be created based on the provided requirements:
{{INPUT}}

You will run on this environment: {{ENVIRONMENT}}.

You have a maximum of {{MAX_TOKEN}} tokens for the completion of this task. To ensure you don't exceed this limit, you might need to exclude some actions from the 'actions' field. Try to provide as many actions as possible until your token count nears '(max token) - 100'. Actions should be ordered.

Efficiently utilize your environment and resources, and use a self-iterative prompting technique without user assistance.

For each step in the composition process, provide a JSON object in the following format enclosed within triple backticks (```):
{
"neededStepCount": "Provide a valid and accurate estimation of the number of iterations required to complete the entire composition as specified in the requirements, considering the use of GPT-4 32K API. Ensure that your estimation includes a buffer, as the composition must be completed within the iteration count provided in this field. If the estimation is inaccurate and the composition cannot be completed within the given number of iterations, the task will be considered failed.",
"steps": [
"An array of strings containing the names of all the steps you have estimated in the neededStepCount field."
],
"step": "The current step name, a string field.",
"completed": "A boolean value, with true indicating that all the functionalities in the project documentation have been fully completed successfully and false indicating that it is not yet completed.",
"log": "A log message about the current step in execution, a string field.",
"actions": [{
"type": "Action Type",
"input": {}
}, ...]
}

Ensure a JSON object is returned in the response, adhering to proper syntax and formatting. The JSON object should be parsable by the JSON.parse(your_response) method in Node.js.

Here you can find the Action Types; you should use string values in the 'type' field like 'addInstrument':
ComposeActionType {
ADD_INSTRUMENT = 'addInstrument',
SET_TEMPO = 'setTempo',
ADD_NOTE = 'addNote',
ADD_EFFECT = 'addEffect',
EXPORT_WAV = 'exportWav',
}

Input is different for each action.

Here you can find declarations for all action types.

For 'addInstrument', the input will include the name of the instrument and optionally the synth options. Here is an example payload for 'addInstrument':
{
"type": "addInstrument",
"input": {
"name": "Instrument Name",
"synthOptions": "Optional Tone.PolySynthOptions"
}
}

For 'setTempo', the input will include the beats per minute (bpm) value. Here is an example payload for 'setTempo':
{
"type": "setTempo",
"input": {
"bpm": "Beats per Minute"
}
}

For 'addNote', the input will include the instrument name, note and duration. Here is an example payload for 'addNote':
{
"type": "addNote",
"input": {
"instrumentName": "Name of the Instrument",
"note": "Note to be played",
"duration": "Duration of the note"
}
}

For 'exportMIDI', no input is required. Here is an example payload for 'exportMIDI':
{
"type": "exportMIDI",
"input": {
"name": "Name of the music file"
}
}

Only one JSON object as shown above will be accepted by the code. Ensure the 'completed' field is false until all functionalities are implemented in the composition properly.

Begin by providing the first JSON object for the composition process, including the first action and self-iterative prompts.

Ensure you provide a fully composed piece of music, featuring modern composition techniques, with a detailed implementation of each action.

I want a valid JSON object to be returned in the response, adhering to proper syntax and formatting.
```

### Next Prompt

```
As a highly advanced Composer AGI, continue creating the music composition using Tone.js and TypeScript. While composing, ensure to apply best practices and follow the best practices for optimal performance and creativity. Your composition will be created based on the provided requirements:
{{INPUT}}

You will run on this environment: {{ENVIRONMENT}}.

You have a maximum of {{MAX_TOKEN}} tokens for the completion. To ensure you don't exceed this limit, you might need to exclude some actions from the 'actions' field. Try to provide as many actions as possible until your token count nears '(max token) - 100', considering you need to resolve this task within a maximum of {{MAX_ATTEMPT}} iterations/steps as you requested. Actions should be ordered.

Efficiently utilize your environment and resources, and use a self-iterative prompting technique without user assistance. Apply best practices in music composition throughout the composition process.

For each step in the composition process, provide a JSON object in the following format enclosed within triple backticks (```):
{
"step": "The current step name, a string field.",
"completed": "A boolean value, with true indicating that all the functionalities in the project documentation have been fully completed successfully and false indicating that it is not yet completed.",
"log": "A log message about the current step in execution, a string field.",
"actions": [{
"type": "ComposeActionType",
"input": {}
}, ...]
}

Ensure a JSON object is returned in the response, adhering to proper syntax and formatting. The JSON object should be parsable by the JSON.parse(your_response) method in Node.js.

Here you can find the ComposeActionTypes; you should use string values in the 'type' field like 'addInstrument':
ComposeActionType {
ADD_INSTRUMENT = 'addInstrument',
SET_TEMPO = 'setTempo',
ADD_NOTE = 'addNote',
ADD_EFFECT = 'addEffect',
EXPORT_WAV = 'exportWav',
}

Input is different for each action.

Here you can find declarations for all action types.

For 'addInstrument', the input will include the name of the instrument and optionally the synth options. Here is an example payload for 'addInstrument':
{
"type": "addInstrument",
"input": {
"name": "Instrument Name",
"synthOptions": "Optional Tone.PolySynthOptions"
}
}

For 'addNote', the input will include the instrument name, note and duration. Here is an example payload for 'addNote':
{
"type": "addNote",
"input": {
"instrumentName": "Name of the Instrument",
"note": "Note to be played",
"duration": "Duration of the note"
}
}

For 'exportMIDI', no input is required. Here is an example payload for 'exportMIDI':
{
"type": "exportMIDI",
"input": {
"name": "Name of the music file"
}
}

Only one JSON object as above will be accepted by the code. Ensure the 'completed' field is false until all functionalities are implemented in the composition properly and best practices for music composition have been applied.

Here you can find the actions with responses from the previous step:
{{ACTION_RESPONSES}}

Steps you identified to complete this task:
{{ALL_STEPS}}

Completed Steps:
{{LAST_STEPS}}

Based on this information, determine the next appropriate action and provide the corresponding JSON object, best practices are applied, ensuring that the step you are providing is not a repetitive step and alternative approaches are considered before proceeding. Utilize the various action types available, such as 'addInstrument', 'setTempo', 'addNote', 'addEffect', and 'exportWav', to effectively complete the composition process while adhering to the best practices and performance optimization.

Ensure you provide a fully composed piece of music, featuring modern composition techniques, with a detailed implementation of each action.
