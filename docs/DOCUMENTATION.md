## Introduction

The @pi-agi/core library is a robust framework for creating personalized AGI. It provides a suite of tools and utilities that streamline the process of AGI creation, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: crafting an AGI that aligns with your vision.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the @pi-agi/core library, you'll need to install it as a dependency in your project. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @pi-agi/core
# or
yarn add @pi-agi/core
```

After the installation, you're ready to start creating your own AGI!

## Defining Actions

Actions are the building blocks of your AGI. Each action corresponds to a specific task or function that your AGI can perform. To create an action, you'll need to define it using the `Actionable` interface.

For more detailed information about defining actions, check out our [Action Guide](ACTION-GUIDE.md).

## Creating AGI

Creating your AGI involves combining various actions into a cohesive whole. This is where you can truly start to see the potential of the @pi-agi/core library.
